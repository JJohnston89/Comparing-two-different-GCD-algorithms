# Comparing-two-different-GCD-algorithms
This is a class project from Analysis of Algorithms course.

The project description that was given: input two integers and compute their greatest common
divisor. This is to be done two ways:

a) Use Euclid's GCD algorithm (page 935 of 3rd edition CLRS text)
b) Find all divisors of each integer and determine largest commnon one.
   Use a modification of the  "trial division" algorithm (see Project 1a above for trial division)
   Note: If you wish, you can try to optimize this by finding prime factors of the integers 
   (which you can do by running the trial division algorithm from 2 to the 
     square root of each integer).

Run each program for a variety of inputs (including integers as large as 
practical) and report the running times for each (you may wish to compute 
running times with library function or simply by using a watch with a 
secondhand). E-mail me your source code and a brief text summary of your 
experimental results.
